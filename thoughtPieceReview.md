# Thought Piece Review by Katherine

## 

- What's persuasive about the thought piece? To whom is it relevant?  
- How could the research question and scope be refined?  
- How feasible is the argument given the time constraints at hand? How could the feasibility be increased?  
- What are some of the technical challenges? Some of the research challenges? How significant are they?  
- How tight is the relationship between the research question and the choice of new media / computation? How could that relationship be tightened? Does the type of argument selected seem like a good fit?  
- What, if anything, is missing from the recipe? What tools, research, data sources, and projects might be added? What other arguments or publications come to mind? (Use the internet to find some answers here?)  
- What other comments or suggestions do you have?
