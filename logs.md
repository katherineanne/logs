##Log 2 Thought Piece   

I aim to address how context creates irony in Thomas King’s The Inconvenient Indian. Irony has been a valuable tool in postcolonial literature because it allows authors to contain multiple layers of meaning within their writing. For example, many of King’s claims initially appeal to white-normative ideology, but once those claims are given historical context they become clearly subversive.How can we demonstrate the importance of context to irony?1.New media and computation could allow me to create a model of the intuitive processes at play when engaging with irony in literature.   2.Alternatively, I could use new media to gather data on reader context and how that influences their perception of King’s irony.While perceiving irony may be a subjective experience, Drucker argues that speculating about the non-objective can create richer humanities research.  1. New media could also allow me to reflect my argument more fully through my form of presentation (Galey).   2. It could also allow me access to information I might not have otherwise considered (McCarty).I’m considering a variety of ways to formulate my argument, so I thought I would include two, for the sake of comparison.    1. A deformance – Stripping the context from several of King’s quotes in order to demonstrate the roll of context in creating irony. This could perhaps take the format of an interactive game that would either provide or withhold context from players depending on choices they make within the game.   2. A poll – Creating an online poll could allow me to gauge how readers interpret ironic quotes by King depending on their race, religion, socio-economic status, etc. For the moment, I am doing my best to move away from creating a computational argument that is purely representational. While creating a deformance, is representational of the role of context in irony, it also denaturalizes King’s main arguments, so it could potentially provide me with new information. Likewise, a poll would move beyond the meaning of the text to focus on reader perception. Recipe   - A selection of ironic quotes from The Inconvenient Indian (print)   - A general overview of the white-normative ideology King is subverting (see Coleman)   - A simple game creator (perhaps a choose your own adventure?) or a simple poll creator Bibliography

##Log 1, 20 January, My Response to Galloway

In the quoted passage, Galloway argues that humanity is moving towards a rhizomatic form of mediation, while it simultaneously rejects hermeneutic and immanent forms of interpretation. Galloway seems to view this networked approach negatively. Looking at text in a general sense, the furies challenge the premise of ontology and aesthetics; the furies are “truly secular”, so they undermine any notion of an underlying truth. While Hermes and Iris suggest there may be something either behind or within the text, the furies reduce all text to "politics" (60).

Galloway seems to imply that within the scholarly world this networked form of mediation undermines criticism. Because the network requires no historical or hermeneutic context, literary and cultural scholarship could be stripped to the mere act of gathering information. Galloway describes the scholar who engages in rhizomatic mediation as nothing more than a “counter”, “diagrammer” or “visualizer” of general information (59). In contrast, scholars engaged in hermeneutic or immanent forms of mediation are still deeply involved in the text itself, whether it is through digging under the surface layer to identify hidden meaning, or allowing oneself to be immersed in the experience of a text. The kind of scholarship Galloway associates with the furies, or the networked system, of mediation seems similar to the kind of scholarship being produced in the digital humanities. For example, Galloway may take issue with the way distant reading in DH allows scholars to arrange information alongside text without necessarily examining the text itself (59, 61).

While Galloway’s assumptions are compelling, I find it difficult to accept that the machine-like mediation of “the swarm” could ever fully replace the role of hermeneutics and immanence. It seems unlikely that diagrams or databases could remain relevance without some form of symptomatic explanation for why they matter.
