## Thought Piece Review
###Adam
Arguement: Recovering the active nature of passive subjects by troubling the centralization of the human subject.  
Form: A game that acts as an extension of the critical argument  

- What's persuasive about the thought piece? To whom is it relevant?
**it could be really convincing to see the passive given active rolls within a game. Ecocrically relevent, decentering humanity** 
- How could the research question and scope be refined?
**Any specific Chaucer texts you can focus on? The Knight's tale or Franklin's tale or Wife of Bath's tale**
- How feasible is the argument given the time constraints at hand? How could the feasibility be increased? 
** It seems feasible as long as the gaming program isn't too time consuming. It may also be difficult to integrate into an essay**
- What are some of the technical challenges? Some of the research challenges? How significant are they? 
**It might not be feasible to create an entirely new game, but it may be possible to alter an already existing game to make a critique**
- How tight is the relationship between the research question and the choice of new media / computation? How could that relationship be tightened? Does the type of argument selected seem like a good fit? 
** The game makes an argument. The game itself serves as an allegory of the passive becoming active **
- What, if anything, is missing from the recipe? What tools, research, data sources, and projects might be added? What other arguments or publications come to mind? (Use the internet to find some answers here?) 
** Look at games that already engage with the passive. Some examples of games to look at, limbo, Agricola, Dear Esther. Check out text by Anna Antropy. Games involving haresting, resource management. A game like Oculus rift scary house might be worth thinking about. Within this game walking through scary house and exploring becomes the fun part. You don't have to acheive something, you could just explore. Interaction rather than forced action **
- What other comments or suggestions do you have?
**Is there a specifical game that engages with nature that could be used/altered to make your argument? Maybe
you could give players options within your game (avatars of lady bath, the knight, etc)**




###Danielle

Argument: "If understood ironically, Wilde's tales are not anti-moral but rather criticize the pervasiveness of a didactic moral voice in children's literature in the Victorian era."  
Form: Use scaler to compare existing illustrations and showcase new ones and demonstrate how illustrations can demonstrate irony

- What's persuasive about the thought piece? To whom is it relevant?   
**Danielle shared two of her main ideas with us. Both were very persuasive.**  


1) **Creating an interactive game based on *The Sisters Brothers*. It would depend on sound and represent how the novel reverts the western novel by taking away the  sight and replacing it with sound. She thought she could create a videogame where you can see, but there is nothing on the screen, there is only sound. For example, you can hear charlie snap his fingers**  
**Since she seemed excited about the idea of using sound, we thought maybe she could incorperate sound into her other project idea. Perhaps she could record readings of Wilde's short stories that uses different emphasis in different ways.**
  
2) **Engaging with irony in illustration.**  
   **We liked her idea of using scaler to compare alternative illustrations for Wilde's short stories. We thought it would be interesting if she could allow viewers to contribute their own images and voices (if she included sound).** **Ashley suggested that Darielle could alter every aspect of presentation in order to demonstrate the effect of design, topography, etc. on the project.**
** She could give readers options of how they want to read the text (dark, light, sweet, violent) by using different themes. This could show how the same text read in different ways makes a completely different reading. Demonstrates second narrative**
** It could be a really interesting contribution to the study of Wilde, since there are so few contemporary versions of Wilde's fairy tales**     

- How could the research question and scope be refined?
How feasible is the argument given the time constraints at hand? How could the feasibility be increased? 
** Danielle's project is more feasible because she isn't required to write an essay alongside. She also may just focus on the nightengale story, which keeps her focus smaller**
- What are some of the technical challenges? Some of the research challenges? How significant are they? 
** She wants to use illustrator for her own illustrations. She may be limited in this aspect depending on how much she can produce**
- How tight is the relationship between the research question and the choice of new media / computation? How could that relationship be tightened? Does the type of argument selected seem like a good fit? 
** This project could demonstrate how context changes readings. It could be really effective to provide new information and interpretations.**
- What, if anything, is missing from the recipe? What tools, research, data sources, and projects might be added? What other arguments or publications come to mind? (Use the internet to find some answers here?) 
**Scaler and Illustrator should mostly cover what she needs to do**** Is there any useful scaler alternatives? She couldn't find anything else that would let her annotate images and videos.** 
- What other comments or suggestions do you have?



###Ashley

Argument: Can John Wilmot's poetry be both religious and a libertine?
Form: Originally Ashley was planning to create an interactive essay using Scaler, CSS, or Active Markdown, but we thought her focus (one poem) could be really conducive for creating a deformance piece.  

- What's persuasive about the thought piece? To whom is it relevant? ** Ashley's argument that certain parts of "To the Postboy" echoe religious poetry is quite convincing. Yet, Rochester's libertine influences are equally apparent in the same poem.**
- How could the research question and scope be refined?
How feasible is the argument given the time constraints at hand? How could the feasibility be increased? **She could provide an interesting critique by deforming the form into purely religious or purely libertine by striping away any contradictory statements. This could be quite feasible because most of this work could be done offline. However, a computer interface of some sort would be necessary to present the two deformative poems without any heirarchy. For example, Ashley talked about making a home page for her deformative poems that would allow the reader to choose between "heaven" or "hell", giving the reader control over which poetic version they want to prioritize.**
- What are some of the technical challenges? Some of the research challenges? How significant are they? 
How tight is the relationship between the research question and the choice of new media / computation? How could that relationship be tightened? Does the type of argument selected seem like a good fit? 
**Because Ashley's focus is so specific (one single poem) it lends itself to deformance. Some technical challenges she could encounter include finding a program that would be conducive for what she is imagining.**
- What, if anything, is missing from the recipe? What tools, research, data sources, and projects might be added? What other arguments or publications come to mind? (Use the internet to find some answers here?) 
**Could she use a program like Wget to pull up examples of religious vocabulary from strictly religious poetry that also occurs in his poem?**
- What other comments or suggestions do you have?
** She focused a lot on small changes, like "I have" vs. "I've" in her original essay. Perhaps it might be worth switching these phrases each time they occur to see what the original choice demonstrates. She could also provide small biographical details about Rochester that could lead the reader to believe the author was religious, or libertine, depending on which "door" they selected (heaven or hell).**





##Log 2, 27 January, Thought Piece   

I aim to address how context creates irony in Thomas King’s *The Inconvenient Indian*. Irony has been a valuable tool in postcolonial literature because it allows authors to contain multiple layers of meaning within their writing. Within King’s text, he uses irony to challenge the assumptions of settler mythology. Many of his claims initially appeal to white-normative ideology, but once those claims are given historical context they become clearly subversive.How does context create irony in *The Inconvenient Indian*?1.New media and computation could allow me to create a model of the intuitive processes at play when engaging with irony in literature.   2.Alternatively, I could use new media to gather data on reader context and how that influences their perception of King’s irony.While perceiving irony may be a subjective experience, Drucker argues that speculating about the non-objective can create richer humanities research.  1. New media could also allow me to reflect my argument more fully through my form of presentation (Galey).   2. It could also allow me access to information I might not have otherwise considered (McCarty).I’m considering a variety of ways to formulate my argument, so I thought I would include two, for the sake of comparison.    1. A deformance – Stripping the context from several of King’s quotes in order to demonstrate the roll of context in creating irony. This could perhaps take the format of an interactive game that would either provide or withhold context from players depending on choices they make within the game.   2. A poll – Creating an online poll could allow me to gauge how readers interpret ironic quotes by King depending on their race, religion, socio-economic status, etc. For the moment, I am doing my best to move away from creating a computational argument that is purely representational. While creating a deformance, is representational of the role of context in irony, it also denaturalizes King’s main arguments, so it could potentially provide me with new information. Likewise, a poll would move beyond the meaning of the text to focus on reader perception. Recipe   - A selection of ironic quotes from *The Inconvenient Indian* (print)   - A general overview of the white-normative ideology King is subverting (see Coleman, Furniss)   - A simple game creator (perhaps a choose your own adventure?) or a simple poll creator Bibliography

##Log 1, 20 January, My Response to Galloway

In the quoted passage, Galloway argues that humanity is moving towards a rhizomatic form of mediation, while it simultaneously rejects hermeneutic and immanent forms of interpretation. Galloway seems to view this networked approach negatively. Looking at text in a general sense, the furies challenge the premise of ontology and aesthetics; the furies are “truly secular”, so they undermine any notion of an underlying truth. While Hermes and Iris suggest there may be something either behind or within the text, the furies reduce all text to "politics" (60).

Galloway seems to imply that within the scholarly world this networked form of mediation undermines criticism. Because the network requires no historical or hermeneutic context, literary and cultural scholarship could be stripped to the mere act of gathering information. Galloway describes the scholar who engages in rhizomatic mediation as nothing more than a “counter”, “diagrammer” or “visualizer” of general information (59). In contrast, scholars engaged in hermeneutic or immanent forms of mediation are still deeply involved in the text itself, whether it is through digging under the surface layer to identify hidden meaning, or allowing oneself to be immersed in the experience of a text. The kind of scholarship Galloway associates with the furies, or the networked system, of mediation seems similar to the kind of scholarship being produced in the digital humanities. For example, Galloway may take issue with the way distant reading in DH allows scholars to arrange information alongside text without necessarily examining the text itself (59, 61).

While Galloway’s assumptions are compelling, I find it difficult to accept that the machine-like mediation of “the swarm” could ever fully replace the role of hermeneutics and immanence. It seems unlikely that diagrams or databases could remain relevance without some form of symptomatic explanation for why they matter.
