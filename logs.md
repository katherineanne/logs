Data:  
In order to make my argument I've used the U.S. Department of the Interior's [map of the Oregon Trail](http://www.blm.gov/or/oregontrail/ortrail-map.php). I've also used several images from [the version of the Oregon Trail video game hosted on the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Oregon_Trail_The_1990) to create an authentic looking spin-off game. In order to insert tribe names on the map in my prototype, I referred to maps featured by the [Native Languages of America](http://www.native-languages.org/states.htm) Organization and the [University of Texas](https://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/histus.html). For my final product I will also be refering to the [map compiled by Aaron Carapella](http://static.squarespace.com/static/5075febfe4b0782fde5414d9/t/51bfdc65e4b00b62a84e8d0f/1371528293927/TRIBALINKSPACEMAPS_ChooseOptions_39x26.pdf), which [priviledges the traditional names](http://www.tribalnationsmaps.com/) of tribes over the names recognized officially, which are sometimes innacurate.

Argument:  
In *The Inconvenient Indian*, Thomas King attempts to reverse the erasure of First Nations peoples from North America’s official history by challenging settler mythology that frames North America as the frontier and legitimizes settler occupation. While King’s book offers a written rhetorical argument, he is writing against a mythology that has been expressed in more than just written media. Non-textual educational tools, like the *Oregon Trail* videogame, have helped to establish the settler-normative version of history. The “procedural rhetoric” (Bogost) of *Oregon Trail* ‘others’ its First Nations characters because it is only playable from the perspective of a white settler. By “unnaming” the Oregon Trail and acknowledging tribes that live along it, my modified version of the game attempts to recreate King’s written argument procedurally. 

I plan to render my project discoverable and will probably feature it on my wordpress account.

## 3 March, Abstract

Reverse Erasure:
Applying Thomas King’s Method of Deformance to the Oregon Trail

Abstract:
In *The Inconvenient Indian* Thomas King highlights the way First Nations groups have been erased from the mainstream version of North American history by rewriting that history from a “Native” perspective. In this project, I will argue that King’s narrative method involves deforming socially embedded narratives in order to create a less Eurocentric history of Canada and the States. I will make this argument by repeating his procedure in a different medium: video games. By deforming the classic video game, *Oregon Trail*, I aim to reveal the social procedure that inscribes settler narratives, and argue that these narratives can only be disrupted by a method of deformance, like that used by King. 
*Oregon Trail* was created by three Minnesota student teachers in 1971, which makes it one of the earliest "edutainment" computer programs (Miller). Over the years, *Oregon Trail* has remained a valued educational tool. The social acceptance of tools like *Oregon Trail* implies that First Nations culture and history continues to be absent from North American historical narratives. I plan to deform this game by swapping the names of places along the trail with the names of First Nations communities who lived in those areas pre-settlement. This deformance may trigger nostalgia in the player, and possibly anger at the act of deformance, thereby demonstrating how nostalgia works to protects both history and vintage video games from critique. Simultaneously, it will repeat the kind of reverse erasure King methodically performs in *The Inconvenient Indian*.

Scope:
Since the borders of First Nations tribes along the Oregon Trail will not necessarily correspond to state borders, I will not be able to acknowledge every tribe along the game’s route.

Concerns
My main concern is with getting the game to run. I am also concerned about not being able to represent all the American tribes along the Oregon Trail. I would also like to rename key landmarks (ex. the rivers the characters need to ford), but suspect that may not be feasible in the time I have left.

## 24 February, Feedback on Projects

Ashley 

- deforming a poem
- make it more and less religious using voiyant - thrown some poems into voyant
- top ten verbs and nouns from against and for religious poems
- basic question - how do I justify these poems as religious or now?
- should I just take the religious example, or should I have a process of using multiple religious poem 
- need to add more poems to religious/libertine - or run a bible through voyant
- top words - a lot of Wilmonts words seem religious without their context
- taking poem out of context when you deform it
- Corpus to work with the poem - have to have ten different versions 
- swapping out words
- you could make it a scale where you change more or less words, but use the same word bank for all variations

Adam

- abandon last plan because of html restrictions, need a server, etc, computer having trouble
- fiddling with text analysis instead, socialized landscape and nonhuman in the social hands cape - ex. larger nodes in a social network
- protovis - lots of interesting colour imagery and species- working from “Our Village” - series of sketches - compared to Jane Austen - textual sketches
- distant reading 

Danielle

- running Eigen face of Wilde in illustrations
- could be a great tool to put out there for others to use too

Me 

- At this point, I’m just planning to change place names. Any other suggestions?
- while hunting, is there any extinct or endangered animals that you could point that out
- establishing forgotten truths, to argue that is what King does in his book - highlighting historical erasure
- maybe at the end could you suddenly provide new names and match what is what?
- could you lose control over the player at the end (like on Mario at the end of a level) where you end up killing a bunch of first nations, levelling traditional lands, etc as a part of winning?

##Log 4, 17 February, Annotated Bibliography

#### Primary Source

**King, Thomas. *The Inconvenient Indian.* Canada: Anchor Canada, 2013. Print.**  

In this unique piece of non-fiction, Thomas King uses his narrative style to retell North American history in order to challenges common racist assumptions about First Nations peoples.   
I will be arguing that King uses specific rhetorical procedures throughout this book to implicate readers in his critique of North American racism.

#### Secondary Sources

**“A Conversation Between Shelagh Rogers and Thomas King.” *The Burden of History.*
Vancouver: UBC Press, 1999. Print.**  

In this interview, included at the end of *the Inconvenient Indian*, Shelagh Rogers asks King to elaborate about specific elements of the book. I am mainly concerned with what King has to say about the use of humour as an effective rhetorical device. 

**Anthropy, Anne, Naomi Clark. *A Game Design Vocabulary: Exploring the Foundational Principles Behind Good Game Design.* Indiana: Addison-Wesley Professional, 2014. Web.**
<http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/book/programming/game-programming/9780133155181>

In their book on game design vocabulary, Anthropy and Clark flesh out key elements of a game in order to provide a framework for those interested in game design. I'm hoping this book will help me understand what steps I will need to follow in order to create, or modify, a game for this project. 

**Bannerji, Himani. “Geography Lessons: On Being an Insider/Outsider to the Canadian 
Nation.” *Unhomely States.* Ed. Cynthia Sugars. Toronto: Broadview Press, 2004. Print.**

In her essay, Bannerji outlines some government policies, like multiculturalism, that have allowed the Canadian government to ignore "the Indian question". Bannerji's deconstruction of multiculturalism helps to clarify some of King's critiques about contemporary Canadian society.

**Coleman, Daniel. *White Civility: The Literary Project of English Canada.* Toronto, ON,
CAN: University of Toronto Press, 2006. ProQuest ebrary. Web.** <http://site.ebrary.com.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/lib/uvic/detail.action?docID=10218812>

In this book, Coleman outlines the way early Canadian literature solidified a white-normative image of "the Canadian" in the national conscious. I refer to Coleman's work in order to establish what historical worldview *The Inconvenient Indian* attempts to rewrite. 

**Furniss, Elizabeth. *The Burden of History.* Vancouver: UBC Press, 1999. Print.**

In this book, anthropologist Elizabeth Furniss carefully documents her research on racial segregation in Williams Lake B.C. during the 1980's and 90's. Furniss also examines what factors contribute to the attitude of "common sense racism" that permeates the town.
Furniss provides fairly contemporary examples of racism towards the First Nations community, which highlight the reality of the problem King aims to address. 


**Goldie, Terry. “Semiotic Control: Native Peoples in Canadian Literature in English.”
*Unhomely States.* Ed. Cynthia Sugars. Toronto: Broadview Press, 2004. Print.**

Goldie uses deconstruction to explain how racism towards Native peoples has already been built into the English language. In this essay, Goldie outlines a key theoretical approach innate in King's argument.
 

**Groening, Laura Smyth. "The Healing Aesthetic of Basil H. Johnston" *Listening to Old Women Speak*. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2004. Print.**

This article highlights the importance of the way a story is told by critiquing the way white critics responded to Johnston's humorous retelling of his residential school experience. Groaning argues that the storytelling form has the ability to rewrite history in a healing way. 

**Hutcheon, Linda. *Splitting Images: Contemporary Canadian Ironies.* Toronto: Oxford
University Press, 1991. Print.**

In this book Hutcheon outlines the variety of ways irony has been used in Canadian literature. In her discussion of postcolonial literature, Hutcheon explains how irony can be used to criticize the dominent political and social culture. Irony is one of the key rhetorical tools King uses in *The Inconvenient Indian*.


**King, Thomas. *The Truth About Stories.* Minnesota: University of Minnesota Press, 2008.
Print.**

*The Truth About Stories* argues that our stories influence the way we view the world. King's juxtaposition of Native and Christian creation stories offers an ideal comparison to show how the mythology we ascribe to shapes our understanding of the world. This same argument can be applied to national mythologies in Canada and the States.  

**Wyile, Herb. “History, Theory, and the Contemporary Canadian Historical Novel”.
*Speculative Fictions.*  Quebec City: McGill-Queen’s University Press, 2002. Print.**

This chapter of Wyile's book outlines how revisionist literature is helping to rewrite the public's understanding of history. Wyile's discussion is revelent because it demonstrates how historical events are always told through a subjective lense. 


## Log 3, 3 February, Revised Thought Piece

My goal for this project would be to demonstrate how Thomas King's narrative in *The Inconvenient Indian* is actually an intentional procedure meant to trick white readers into confronting their own racial prejudices. King often begins chapters throughout the book with a claim that appeals to the historical Frontier Myth (Furniss) and it's contemporary version, the White-normative concept of civility (Coleman). After making this claim, the rest of the chapter goes on to list carefully documented events that undermine King's initial statement. If the reader agrees with King's initial premise, they will later be implicated in his postcolonial critique.

I would like to argue that King's method of narration is designed to entrap readers by turning his process into an interactive game.  I like the way many of Pedercini's games make an obvious argument, but I'm not sure if that would actually demonstrate the procedure King uses in his narrative. King produces his procedure in a print media, which allows him to withold his postcolonial critique from first time readers until they read further into the book. I would like to reproduce this ambush of information within a game. It might be possible to create something like Nicky Case's "coming out simulator" or Merritt Kopas "Dee's Big Night", but if I wanted to provide users with choices to select, I would probably have to move beyond the text, which is something I would like to avoid. 

Since Galloway argues that play is already "a symbolic action for larger issues in culture" (17). I might look into how difficult it would be to mod or hack an already existing game, like "Oregon Trail", that functions within the Frontier Myth King is challenging. It could allow me to surprise users who initially engage with the game out of a sense of nostalgia. My goal would be to recreate King's process of gently leading readers into recognizing the problematic way history has been told, and how it continues to affect the present.


## Thought Piece Review, In Class, 27 January
###Adam
Arguement: Recovering the active nature of passive subjects by troubling the centralization of the human subject.  
Form: A game that acts as an extension of the critical argument  

- What's persuasive about the thought piece? To whom is it relevant?
**it could be really convincing to see the passive given active rolls within a game. Ecocrically relevent, decentering humanity** 
- How could the research question and scope be refined?
**Any specific Chaucer texts you can focus on? The Knight's tale or Franklin's tale or Wife of Bath's tale**
- How feasible is the argument given the time constraints at hand? How could the feasibility be increased? 
**It seems feasible as long as the gaming program isn't too time consuming. It may also be difficult to integrate into an essay**
- What are some of the technical challenges? Some of the research challenges? How significant are they? 
**It might not be feasible to create an entirely new game, but it may be possible to alter an already existing game to make a critique**
- How tight is the relationship between the research question and the choice of new media / computation? How could that relationship be tightened? Does the type of argument selected seem like a good fit? 
**The game makes an argument. The game itself serves as an allegory of the passive becoming active**
- What, if anything, is missing from the recipe? What tools, research, data sources, and projects might be added? What other arguments or publications come to mind? (Use the internet to find some answers here?) 
**Look at games that already engage with the passive. Some examples of games to look at, limbo, Agricola, Dear Esther. Check out text by Anna Antropy. Games involving haresting, resource management. A game like Oculus rift scary house might be worth thinking about. Within this game walking through scary house and exploring becomes the fun part. You don't have to acheive something, you could just explore. Interaction rather than forced action**
- What other comments or suggestions do you have?
**Is there a specifical game that engages with nature that could be used/altered to make your argument?** **Maybe you could give players options within your game (avatars of lady bath, the knight, etc)**




###Danielle

Argument: "If understood ironically, Wilde's tales are not anti-moral but rather criticize the pervasiveness of a didactic moral voice in children's literature in the Victorian era."  
Form: Use scaler to compare existing illustrations and showcase new ones and demonstrate how illustrations can demonstrate irony

- What's persuasive about the thought piece? To whom is it relevant?   
**Danielle shared two of her main ideas with us. Both were very persuasive.**  


1) **Creating an interactive game based on *The Sisters Brothers*. It would depend on sound and represent how the novel reverts the western novel by taking away the  sight and replacing it with sound. She thought she could create a videogame where you can see, but there is nothing on the screen, there is only sound. For example, you can hear charlie snap his fingers**  
**Since she seemed excited about the idea of using sound, we thought maybe she could incorperate sound into her other project idea. Perhaps she could record readings of Wilde's short stories that uses different emphasis in different ways.**
  
2) **Engaging with irony in illustration.**  
   **We liked her idea of using scaler to compare alternative illustrations for Wilde's short stories. We thought it would be interesting if she could allow viewers to contribute their own images and voices (if she included sound).** **Ashley suggested that Darielle could alter every aspect of presentation in order to demonstrate the effect of design, topography, etc. on the project.**
**She could give readers options of how they want to read the text (dark, light, sweet, violent) by using different themes. This could show how the same text read in different ways makes a completely different reading. Demonstrates second narrative. It could be a really interesting contribution to the study of Wilde, since there are so few contemporary versions of Wilde's fairy tales**     

- How could the research question and scope be refined?
How feasible is the argument given the time constraints at hand? How could the feasibility be increased? 
**Danielle's project is more feasible because she isn't required to write an essay alongside. She also may just focus on the nightengale story, which keeps her focus smaller**
- What are some of the technical challenges? Some of the research challenges? How significant are they? 
**She wants to use illustrator for her own illustrations. She may be limited in this aspect depending on how much she can produce**
- How tight is the relationship between the research question and the choice of new media / computation? How could that relationship be tightened? Does the type of argument selected seem like a good fit? 
**This project could demonstrate how context changes readings. It could be really effective to provide new information and interpretations.**
- What, if anything, is missing from the recipe? What tools, research, data sources, and projects might be added? What other arguments or publications come to mind? (Use the internet to find some answers here?) 
**Scaler and Illustrator should mostly cover what she needs to do. Is there any useful scaler alternatives? She couldn't find anything else that would let her annotate images and videos.** 
- What other comments or suggestions do you have?



###Ashley

Argument: Can John Wilmot's poetry be both religious and a libertine?
Form: Originally Ashley was planning to create an interactive essay using Scaler, CSS, or Active Markdown, but we thought her focus (one poem) could be really conducive for creating a deformance piece.  

- What's persuasive about the thought piece? To whom is it relevant? **Ashley's argument that certain parts of "To the Postboy" echoe religious poetry is quite convincing. Yet, Rochester's libertine influences are equally apparent in the same poem.**
- How could the research question and scope be refined?
How feasible is the argument given the time constraints at hand? How could the feasibility be increased? **She could provide an interesting critique by deforming the form into purely religious or purely libertine by striping away any contradictory statements. This could be quite feasible because most of this work could be done offline. However, a computer interface of some sort would be necessary to present the two deformative poems without any heirarchy. For example, Ashley talked about making a home page for her deformative poems that would allow the reader to choose between "heaven" or "hell", giving the reader control over which poetic version they want to prioritize.**
- What are some of the technical challenges? Some of the research challenges? How significant are they? 
How tight is the relationship between the research question and the choice of new media / computation? How could that relationship be tightened? Does the type of argument selected seem like a good fit? 
**Because Ashley's focus is so specific (one single poem) it lends itself to deformance. Some technical challenges she could encounter include finding a program that would be conducive for what she is imagining.**
- What, if anything, is missing from the recipe? What tools, research, data sources, and projects might be added? What other arguments or publications come to mind? (Use the internet to find some answers here?) 
**Could she use a program like Wget to pull up examples of religious vocabulary from strictly religious poetry that also occurs in his poem?**
- What other comments or suggestions do you have?
**She focused a lot on small changes, like "I have" vs. "I've" in her original essay. Perhaps it might be worth switching these phrases each time they occur to see what the original choice demonstrates. She could also provide small biographical details about Rochester that could lead the reader to believe the author was religious, or libertine, depending on which "door" they selected (heaven or hell).**









##Log 2, 27 January, Thought Piece   

I aim to address how context creates irony in Thomas King’s *The Inconvenient Indian*. Irony has been a valuable tool in postcolonial literature because it allows authors to contain multiple layers of meaning within their writing. Within King’s text, he uses irony to challenge the assumptions of settler mythology. Many of his claims initially appeal to white-normative ideology, but once those claims are given historical context they become clearly subversive.

How does context create irony in *The Inconvenient Indian*?

1.New media and computation could allow me to create a model of the intuitive processes at play when engaging with irony in literature.   
2.Alternatively, I could use new media to gather data on reader context and how that influences their perception of King’s irony.

While perceiving irony may be a subjective experience, Drucker argues that speculating about the non-objective can create richer humanities research.  
1. New media could also allow me to reflect my argument more fully through my form of presentation (Galey).   
2. It could also allow me access to information I might not have otherwise considered (McCarty).

I’m considering a variety of ways to formulate my argument, so I thought I would include two, for the sake of comparison.    
1. A deformance – Stripping the context from several of King’s quotes in order to demonstrate the roll of context in creating irony. This could perhaps take the format of an interactive game that would either provide or withhold context from players depending on choices they make within the game.   
2. A poll – Creating an online poll could allow me to gauge how readers interpret ironic quotes by King depending on their race, religion, socio-economic status, etc. 

For the moment, I am doing my best to move away from creating a computational argument that is purely representational. While creating a deformance, is representational of the role of context in irony, it also denaturalizes King’s main arguments, so it could potentially provide me with new information. Likewise, a poll would move beyond the meaning of the text to focus on reader perception. 

Recipe   
- A selection of ironic quotes from *The Inconvenient Indian* (print)   
- A general overview of the white-normative ideology King is subverting (see Coleman, Furniss)   
- A simple game creator (perhaps a choose your own adventure?) or a simple poll creator

##Log 1, 20 January, My Response to Galloway

In the quoted passage, Galloway argues that humanity is moving towards a rhizomatic form of mediation, while it simultaneously rejects hermeneutic and immanent forms of interpretation. Galloway seems to view this networked approach negatively. Looking at text in a general sense, the furies challenge the premise of ontology and aesthetics; the furies are “truly secular”, so they undermine any notion of an underlying truth. While Hermes and Iris suggest there may be something either behind or within the text, the furies reduce all text to "politics" (60).

Galloway seems to imply that within the scholarly world this networked form of mediation undermines criticism. Because the network requires no historical or hermeneutic context, literary and cultural scholarship could be stripped to the mere act of gathering information. Galloway describes the scholar who engages in rhizomatic mediation as nothing more than a “counter”, “diagrammer” or “visualizer” of general information (59). In contrast, scholars engaged in hermeneutic or immanent forms of mediation are still deeply involved in the text itself, whether it is through digging under the surface layer to identify hidden meaning, or allowing oneself to be immersed in the experience of a text. The kind of scholarship Galloway associates with the furies, or the networked system, of mediation seems similar to the kind of scholarship being produced in the digital humanities. For example, Galloway may take issue with the way distant reading in DH allows scholars to arrange information alongside text without necessarily examining the text itself (59, 61).

While Galloway’s assumptions are compelling, I find it difficult to accept that the machine-like mediation of “the swarm” could ever fully replace the role of hermeneutics and immanence. It seems unlikely that diagrams or databases could remain relevance without some form of symptomatic explanation for why they matter.
